CivicSpace is unlicensed.

“Unlicensed” does not mean “public domain.” This code was released to the public and doesn’t come with a specific license.
By default, the copyright for unlicensed code belongs to its creator, who must grant explicit permission for you to use it. 
The safest way to approach unlicensed code is to treat it as proprietary (i.e., not open source).
